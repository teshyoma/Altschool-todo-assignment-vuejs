<!--
In this project, I created a todo list that can edit the content in the h2 tag which is for example: Welcome back!!! username, the username can be edited, the user has the option of changing names.
 -->

 <!-- 
 Also there are two categories in my todo list, they are Urgent and Casual, for Urgent, these are lists that are Very important, that needs to be done on time or urgently while for casual, these are lists that are important but not urgent. The user can create a list that falls under any of these two categories
  -->

<!--
  Also, the lists can be edited too, all you just need to do is erase the list item and add another item to it
-->

<!--
 A delete button was created to delete the content of the list and also the user can view all the todo list that is shown
 -->
